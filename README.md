# Introduction
Welcome to **LE/EECS 4443 (Section M, Labs 01-02, Winter 2025)**! 

My name is [Shogo](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/shogo-toyonaga) and I will be your teaching assistant. I look forward to working and learning with you over the next four months ðŸ˜Š.

The goal of this course shell is to share and disseminate supplementary materials (recitations) that re-inforce important course learning objectives. Furthermore, as the course progresses, commonly asked questions and hints about labs will be released here!

## Course Description
The design and implementation of user interfaces for touchscreen devices and tablet computers. Students develop user interfaces that include touch, multi-touch, vibration, device motion, position, and orientation, environment sensing, video capture, and audio capture. Twelve Supervised laboratory hours that emphasize these topics in a practical manner. 

**Prerequisites:** General prerequisite; LE/EECS 2030 3.00 or LE/EECS 1030 3.00; LE/EECS 3461 3.00. (NOTE: The General Prerequisite is a cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses. EECS courses with the second digit "5" are not major courses.)
