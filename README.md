# Introduction
Welcome to **LE/EECS XXXX (Section X, Lab Y, Winter 2025)**! 

My name is [Shogo](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/shogo-toyonaga) and I will be your teaching assistant. I look forward to working and learning with you over the next four months ðŸ˜Š.

The goal of this course shell is to share and disseminate supplementary materials (recitations) that re-inforce important course learning objectives. Furthermore, as the course progresses, commonly asked questions and hints about labs will be released here!
