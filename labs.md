# Labs (FAQ)

## General
1. I'm really lost with Android Studio... Do you have a textbook reference for the course?

    **TA Response:** Please speak with the teaching team as soon as possible. We are here to help you and wish to see you succeed. I highly recommend the textbook, [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd)](https://www.amazon.ca/Android-Programming-Nerd-Ranch-Guide/dp/0134706056). It has comprehensive case-studies and all of the demos are written in Java.

2. It has been quite some time since I wrote Java... Do you have any references that could be helpful?

    **TA Response:** I found the textbook, [Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures, Comprehensive Version (11th)](https://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Programming-Structures-Comprehensive-Version/dp/0134670949) to be very helpful. Furthermore, this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28) by  [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/@thenewboston) is a great resource. I highly recommend it.
