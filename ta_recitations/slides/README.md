| Slides | Description | 
| ----- | ----- | 
| Week 1 - Course Introduction | Covers a brief TA introduction, lab logistics, and supplementary resources to help you learn and master the course objectives. |
| Week 1 - Android App Anatomy | Introduces students to the Model-View Controller (MVC) software design pattern. The most crucial Android components are introduced such as the Manifest, Build Gradle, and Activity. Layouts are briefly discussed, however, it is the students responsibility to read the documentation. Lastly, event listeners are covered with two case studies and demo code. |
| Week 2 - Developing Good UI and Software | Introduces students to practical design guidelines, dark patterns, and software design patterns with relation to Android App Development (e.g., Model-View Controller). |
| Week 3 - Human-Computer Interaction and the Activity Lifecycle | Introduces students to the prerequisite knowledge required to plan and carry out a user study. Students are also introduced to the Android Activity Lifecycle. By the end of the tutorial, they should be able to build applications that can save and restore themselves upon their destruction. |
| Week 4 - Advanced Layouts & UI Building Blocks | Introduces students to static and dynamic layouts. The fundamentals are comprehensively discussed with multiple demos. UI Building blocks and design choices are briefly discussed to help students prepare for their assignment. |
| Week 5 - Touch, Multi-Touch, & Gesture Detection | Introduces students to touch gestures with GestureDetector and ScaleGestureDetector. Furthermore, this set of slides and its demos introduces students to Intents; mainly, how to dynamically load new images into existing widgets (ImageView). Lastly, this weeks demos explore how to play sounds (tones) from Android Studio using ToneGenerator. These concepts will be very useful for Labs #3 through #5. |
| Week 6 - Software & UI Testing | Introduces students to Software Design and UI Testing frameworks. A comprehensive demo is provided to illustrate the workflow of writing Espesso & UI Automator tests. This will be particularly useful for your assignment and course project. |
| Week 7 - Performance, Profiling, Monitoring, & Benchmarking | Introduces students on how to measure and quantify performance metrics using tools provided by Android Studio. Particular emphasis is placed on properly choosing the right test and accounting for confounding variables. Profiling and Benchmarking are comprehensively discussed with a case study. Students are encouraged to run the benchmarks themselves and write additional test cases to prepare them for the assignment and project components. |
| Week 8 - Introduction to Sensors & View Flavours | Introduces students to managing and polling data from Android sensors. New Views are introduced and a short case study is presented on how to subclass the View class and create your own custom widgets. |
| Week 9 - Advanced Activities & Animations | Students are introduced to more sophisticated Android Activity interactions and supports. Firstly, they will gain hands-on experience in (1) using intents to facilitate communication between multiple Activities, (2) supporting basic action bar utilities, (3) implementing and designing fragments, and (4) supporting basic view animations. |
